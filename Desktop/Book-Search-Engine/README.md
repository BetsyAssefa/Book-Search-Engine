# Book Search Engine

## Description
The **Book Search Engine** is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books to a personal account, and manage their saved book list. This application uses a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and incorporates GraphQL for querying the backend API.
